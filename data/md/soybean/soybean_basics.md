# Soybean Cultivation Basics

## Introduction to Soybeans

Soybeans (Glycine max) are one of the most important legume crops globally, providing protein and oil for human consumption, animal feed, and industrial uses. They are native to East Asia and have been cultivated for over 5,000 years.

## Soil Requirements

### Soil Type
- Well-drained soils with good organic matter content
- pH between 6.0-6.8 is optimal
- Avoid waterlogged or compacted soils

### Soil Preparation
- Deep plowing in fall or early spring
- Incorporate organic matter such as compost or manure
- Ensure good soil structure for root development

## Planting

### Timing
- Plant after soil temperature reaches 55°F (13°C)
- Typically late April to early June in northern regions
- Avoid planting too early to prevent seed rot

### Seeding Rate
- 140,000-180,000 seeds per acre
- Adjust based on soil conditions and variety
- Plant depth: 1-2 inches depending on soil moisture

## Growth Stages

### Vegetative Stages (V)
- VE: Emergence
- VC: Cotyledon stage
- V1, V2, V3... Vn: Number of trifoliate leaves

### Reproductive Stages (R)
- R1: Beginning bloom
- R2: Full bloom
- R3: Beginning pod
- R4: Full pod
- R5: Beginning seed
- R6: Full seed
- R7: Beginning maturity
- R8: Full maturity

## Nutrient Management

### Nitrogen
- Soybeans fix their own nitrogen through symbiosis with Rhizobia bacteria
- Inoculation with appropriate rhizobia strains is recommended
- Minimal nitrogen fertilizer needed if good nodulation occurs

### Phosphorus and Potassium
- Apply based on soil test recommendations
- Critical for pod fill and seed development
- Typical rates: 30-60 lbs P2O5 and 60-120 lbs K2O per acre

## Water Management

### Water Requirements
- 20-25 inches of water throughout growing season
- Critical periods: flowering (R1-R2) and pod fill (R3-R6)
- Monitor soil moisture regularly

### Irrigation
- Use when rainfall is insufficient
- Avoid over-irrigation which can reduce nodulation
- Drip irrigation is most efficient

## Pest and Disease Management

### Common Pests
- Soybean aphid (Aphis glycines)
- Bean leaf beetle (Cerotoma trifurcata)
- Stink bugs (various species)
- Thrips and spider mites

### Disease Prevention
- Crop rotation with non-host crops
- Use disease-resistant varieties
- Proper plant spacing for air circulation
- Fungicide applications when necessary

### Common Diseases
- Sudden death syndrome (SDS)
- Phytophthora root rot
- White mold (Sclerotinia)
- Frogeye leaf spot

## Harvesting

### Maturity Indicators
- Leaves turn yellow and drop
- Pods turn brown and rattle when shaken
- Seed moisture content: 13-15% for storage

### Harvest Timing
- Don't delay harvest to avoid shattering losses
- Early morning harvest when dew is present reduces shattering
- Combine settings: reduce ground speed, adjust cylinder speed

## Storage and Marketing

### Drying
- Dry to 13% moisture for safe storage
- Use proper drying temperatures to maintain quality
- Avoid over-drying which reduces test weight

### Storage Conditions
- Cool, dry environment
- Monitor for insects and rodents
- Adequate ventilation to prevent heating

## Economic Considerations

### Cost Factors
- Seed costs: $30-50 per acre
- Fertilizer and chemicals: $50-100 per acre
- Machinery costs: $75-125 per acre

### Marketing Options
- Cash sales at harvest
- Forward contracts
- Storage and delayed sales
- Value-added processing
