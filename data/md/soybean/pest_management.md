# Soybean Pest Management

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

Effective soybean pest management requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical control methods. Regular field scouting is essential for early detection and timely intervention.

## Major Insect Pests

### Soybean Aphid (Aphis glycines)

#### Identification
- Small, pale yellow to light green insects
- Cluster on undersides of leaves and stems
- Produce honeydew causing sooty mold

#### Economic Threshold
- 250 aphids per plant with increasing populations
- 80% of plants infested

#### Management
- Natural enemies: lady beetles, lacewings, parasitic wasps
- Foliar insecticides when threshold is reached
- Resistant varieties where available

### Bean Leaf Beetle (Cerotoma trifurcata)

#### Identification
- 1/4 inch long, variable color (yellow, red, tan)
- Four black spots on wing covers
- Feed on leaves creating round holes

#### Damage Assessment
- Defoliation during vegetative stages: 30% threshold
- Pod feeding during reproductive stages: 5% pod scarring

#### Control Measures
- Monitor during emergence and pod fill
- Insecticide applications if thresholds exceeded
- Row covers for severe infestations

### Stink Bugs (Brown marmorated, Green, Brown)

#### Identification
- Shield-shaped insects, 1/2 to 3/4 inch long
- Feed on developing seeds causing shriveled beans
- Can detect characteristic odor when disturbed

#### Economic Impact
- Direct feeding damage to seeds
- Reduced seed quality and germination
- Delayed maturity

#### Management Strategies
- Field scouting from R3 through R6 stages
- Threshold: 1 stink bug per 3 feet of row
- Border treatments often sufficient

## Disease Management

### Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS)

#### Symptoms
- Interveinal chlorosis and necrosis
- Leaves remain attached to petioles
- Taproot shows blue-gray discoloration

#### Management
- Plant resistant varieties
- Improve soil drainage
- Reduce soil compaction
- Avoid early planting in cold, wet soils

### Phytophthora Root Rot

#### Causal Agent
- Phytophthora sojae (water mold)
- Survives in soil as oospores
- Favored by wet, poorly drained soils

#### Prevention
- Plant resistant varieties with Rps genes
- Improve field drainage
- Avoid planting in wet conditions
- Seed treatment fungicides

### White Mold (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum)

#### Environmental Conditions
- Cool, wet weather during flowering
- Dense canopy with poor air circulation
- Previous history of disease in field

#### Management Practices
- Wider row spacing (30-inch vs 15-inch)
- Avoid excessive nitrogen
- Fungicide applications at R1-R3 if conditions favor disease
- Crop rotation with non-host crops

### Frogeye Leaf Spot (Cercospora sojina)

#### Identification
- Circular lesions with gray centers
- Dark borders resembling frog eyes
- Can affect leaves, stems, and pods

#### Control Methods
- Resistant varieties
- Crop rotation
- Foliar fungicides if severe
- Residue management

## Nematode Management

### Soybean Cyst Nematode (SCN)

#### Most Important Pest
- Heterodera glycines
- Can cause 30% yield loss without symptoms
- Forms cysts on roots

#### Management
- Resistant varieties (rotate sources of resistance)
- Non-host crop rotation (corn, small grains)
- Nematicide seed treatments
- Soil sampling every 3-4 years

### Root-knot Nematodes

#### Symptoms
- Galling on roots
- Stunted growth
- Chlorosis and wilting

#### Prevention
- Crop rotation with non-host crops
- Resistant varieties where available
- Soil fumigation in severe cases

## Weed Management

### Pre-emergence Herbicides

#### Soil-applied Options
- Metribuzin for broadleaf control
- S-metolachlor for grass control
- Pendimethalin for annual grasses

#### Application Timing
- Apply after planting but before emergence
- Requires adequate moisture for activation
- Consider soil type and organic matter

### Post-emergence Herbicides

#### Glyphosate Systems
- Roundup Ready varieties
- Multiple application timings
- Tank mix partners for resistance management

#### Non-glyphosate Options
- Liberty Link system (glufosinate)
- Conventional herbicides (bentazon, imazamox)
- Mechanical cultivation

## Resistance Management

### Herbicide Resistance
- Rotate herbicide modes of action
- Use multiple herbicides with different sites of action
- Include cultural practices (cover crops, tillage)

### Insecticide Resistance
- Rotate insecticide classes
- Preserve beneficial insects
- Use economic thresholds

### Disease Resistance
- Rotate sources of genetic resistance
- Combine with cultural practices
- Monitor for new races/strains

## Field Scouting Guidelines

### Frequency
- Weekly during vegetative growth
- 2-3 times per week during reproductive stages
- More frequent during pest outbreaks

### Sampling Methods
- Walk fields in a systematic pattern
- Sample multiple locations per field
- Document findings with photos and notes

### Record Keeping
- Pest levels and distributions
- Control measures applied
- Weather conditions
- Yield impacts

## Economic Considerations

### Treatment Decisions
- Calculate cost of control vs. potential loss
- Consider market prices and yield potential
- Factor in application costs and timing

### Return on Investment
- Preventive measures vs. curative treatments
- Long-term vs. short-term benefits
- Integrated approach cost-effectiveness
